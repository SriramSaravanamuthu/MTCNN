# MTCNN
Exploring MTCNN
  The bounding box is formatted as [x, y, width, height] under the key ‘box’.
  The confidence is the probability for a bounding box to be matching a face.
  The keypoints are formatted into a JSON object with the keys ‘left_eye’, ‘right_eye’, ‘nose’,     ‘mouth_left’, ‘mouth_right’. Each keypoint is identified by a pixel position (x, y).
